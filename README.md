# ResilientFlow-AI-Powered-Supply-Chain-Resilience-Platform
## Description: 
    Automatically clean, validate, and standardize supply chain data using Python and AI techniques.
## Overview: 
    Supply chain management involves the exchange of massive volumes of data across multiple stakeholders including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and logistics providers. This data often suffers from inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured formats, making it unreliable for decision-making or analytics.
    This project aims to address those challenges through an AI-powered data preprocessing pipeline using Python.
    It reads raw supply chain data and performs: Data Cleaning, Standardization of Columns and Text, Duplicate Removal, and Export of Cleaned Dataset.
## Structure:
    - supply_chain_data.csv: Raw input dataset
    - cleaned_supply_chain_data.csv: Output cleaned dataset
    - AI_Powered_data_validation.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook
    - README.md: Project documentation
## Features:
    - Automatically handles missing values (forward fill method)
    - Standardizes column names using regex (removes special characters)
    - Converts all text to lowercase for consistency
    - Removes duplicate entries
    - Outputs a clean CSV ready for analytics or ML
## Technologies:
    - Python 3.x
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Regex (re)
    - Jupyter Notebook
## Use_cases:
    - Preprocessing pipelines for AI/ML models in logistics
    - Dashboards for supply chain KPIs
    - ERP or SCM systems for automated data ingestion
